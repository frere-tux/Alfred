# A.L.F.R.E.D.

Home and art automation system on a Raspberry Pi. Here you'll find:
- A realtime, multithreaded automation c++ server (with task management and scheduler)
- Some FM radio communication to control and receive information from external devices 
- A web interface and a php/c++ wrapper to communicate with the server

This is a work in progress. Please ignore the mess and the lack of comments.
